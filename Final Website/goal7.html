                Clean energy has recently become one of the world's hottest topics, as scientific breakthrough and innovation shifts its focus to this rapidly emerging field. To our cozy spot in our brightly-lit homes, access to electricity is not a problem we think about at all in our day to day lives. However, elsewhere in the world that statistic is very different. One in seven people lack access to electricity across the world. To build up the infrastructure for this, it'll require a ton of land and resources to create the necessary power plants to generate this electricity. Most of the energy will also have to be generated using clean, renewable energy. As of the status quo, we are very much behind where we need to be as a society in terms of where our energy comes from. Much of that is a result of lagging scientific innovation, though our progress is growing exponentially. With breakthroughs in the energy sector, there is no doubt that we have already made strides towards our goal, though there is still much left to be done.

                    <p>It's common knowledge that factories and industry are a major contributor to climate change through the sheer amount of emissions that come out of the factories. These edifices spout out many pollutants, including organic solvents, sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NO3), among many more. These emissions contribute to phenomena associated with climate change such as an amplified greenhouse effect, the ozone hole, and desertification.

                    <p>Leakage from the industries that involve hazardous materials are the main causes of land contamination and land pollution in many countries around the globe. Oil refineries and pipelines transporting gas, metal treatment and coating factories, chemical plants, and the textile industry are all examples where the byproducts have the capacity to seriously harm the environment. The properties of soil mean that these pollutants stay in the soil for generations after.

                    <p>Considering the massive amounts of coal, gas and oil we consume every single day on the roads, in the air and on sea it's no surprise that we're literally spitting out immense amounts of pollution into our air. We're at the point now where we cannot afford to use anymore non-renewables, lest we damage our atmosphere beyond repair. The alternative as such, is turning towards renewable energies and resources to fuel humanity's insatiable desire for energy and electricity.

As such, researchers and scientists all over the world have been actively working to develop technologies that permit us to make electricity not only cleaner so as to reduce the impacts, but more accessible to everyone in developing nations as well.

                If you take a look at the statistics, you'll see that it's imperative that we as the international community take action immediately to try and remedy some of the damage we've done to our environment. We've made headway into our goals in combatting climate change, whilst adapting our energy production methods to meet a growing population, but it's not where it needs to be yet. Yet as the population continues to grow, so will the demand for cheap energy, and an economy reliant on fossil fuels is creating drastic changes to our climate. To really create and catalyze change, it's vital that we invest more into solar, wind and thermal power, improving energy productivity, and ensuring energy if we are to achieve SDG 7 by 2030. Additionally, it's also vital that we expand and reiterate our existing infrastructure if we are to make it more accessible and more convenient for people. Especially to those in developing nations but also developed nations, we must provide clean and more efficient energy in all countries and that alone will encourage energy growth and help the environment.
