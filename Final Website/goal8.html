                In a world that has been largely powered by industrial progress and import/export, it makes sense that these processes are also directly linked to economic growth. Over the past 25 years the number of workers living in extreme poverty has declined dramatically, despite the lasting impact of the 2008 economic crisis and global recession. In addition, the middle class now takes up 34% of the population, tripling the number that was present only a few decades ago. This rapid growth is not sustainable, however. We are already seeing slower growth, widening inequalities, and not enough jobs to keep up with a growing labour force. This rapid growth also brings unemployment as different jobs are created, but the same amount, if not more are lost. According to the United Nations, "encouraging entrepreneurship and job creation are key to this". Having people set up their own businesses and creating their own cash flow is key to catalyzing economic growth in these regions. The eighth UNSDG strives to achieve stable economic growth and enough employment by 2030 for men and women alike.

                    <p>In terms of increasing wealth for all wealth demographics across the board, there are promising results. It has been projected that by 2030, 5.4 billion people will be middle-class, up from 3 billion in 2015 according to Standard Chartered and the Brookings Institution. Most of this increase comes from developing nations such as Southern Asia as well as Africa. It is predicted that Europe and North American wealth classes will not change substantially.

In 2017, we had around 300 million workers living in extreme poverty, and over 470 million jobs will have to be created to prevent the labour market from becoming saturate with all of the new entrants into the workforce by 2030.

This is why less developed economies who usually have relatively low GDP "develop" while the developed economies such as those that have already been established (think USA or Europe) “grow”.

                Analyzing all of the numbers, we can see that there is in fact a long way to go in terms of achieving this goal. While the numbers may not seem very impactful to us because of how low our rates of unemployment are in comparison to developing nations, in places like Africa or underdeveloped Asia, such circumstance is unfortunately often the norm. We have been blessed with the good fortune of having a stable economy and developed job market. The above statistics really just go to show the disparity in economic development between the developed and developing nations. Once again, the data represents the fact that as the global economy begins to recover more and more from the 2008 crisis, we're seeing a larger disparity in terms of inequality for the rich and poor, in addition to a lack of jobs for all the new people in the expanded labour market.
