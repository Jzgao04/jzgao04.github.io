                If this project were to be done only 20 years ago, these two would have been separate entities, in separate universes. Flash forward to the present and we find ourselves in the peculiar situation of having these two become more and more intertwined as the years go on. Climate change has undoubtedly become one of the world's most pressing matters. How will we generate enough energy for all of Earth's population, and at what cost will that come to the land we live on and the people that inhabit it? Economic growth has long been at the forefront of international policy, although the beast of how to actually solve it was never tamed properly. How do we kickstart their economies and economic growth, when the cheapest solutions, come at the biggest consequences for Earth? As such, the question for the next 2 decades, will become: "Is it possible to have economic growth whilst also being environmentally conscious?" This simple question will undoubtedly guide how the industries and sectors of the next 20 years move and evolve.

                    <p>Most economic growth now happens in countries that are relatively poor. The International Monetary Fund estimates that from 2010 to 2015, emerging markets and developing countries were responsible for about 70 percent of global output and consumption growth, while advanced economies were responsible for the rest. The World Bank’s forecasts for 2017-2019 are similar:

                    <h3 class="h2">Growth for Poor</h3>
                    <p>In 2017, the International Energy Agency estimated that the growth in energy-related carbon emissions in China and the rest of developing Asia was more than five times the growth in the European Union, while U.S. emissions declined. In other words, if we stop economic growth, it won’t be rich countries that bear the brunt of the change. It will be poor and middle-income countries like India and China. African countries that are still desperately poor will not even get their chance.

                    <h3 class="h2">Fertility and Growth</h3>
                    <p>Once countries pass per-capita gross domestic product of $10,000, fertility rates rapidly drop to or below the replacement rate of 2.1 children per woman. Halting growth now would leave most African countries trapped well below that magic level, meaning their population growth — and thus, the world’s population growth — would continue without limit. That in turn would eventually overwhelm the world’s resources — if not in terms of the climate, then certainly in terms of fresh water and food.

                    <p>In many regions, wind and solar are already cheaper than coal power, and electric vehicles are rapidly becoming more common. This incredible technological progress means that rich countries could see a renewable-powered electrical grid and fully electrified transportation before the century is out. More importantly, cheap renewable energy means that poor countries in Africa and South Asia will be able to follow a different, cleaner path to industrialization without sacrificing living standards. Ultimately, technological progress will be much more important for limiting global resource use than the energy-efficiency measures opponents propose.

                If you look at the images, you'll see that when you compare England's GDP over time and compare that to the GDP of sub-Saharan Africa, there is in fact noticeable disparities in wealth. This ties into the fact that it becomes really hard for these poor countries to become more wealthy through GDP growth since they'll have to industrialize. History has taught us that this is the most effacious method to catalyze growth, but it comes at a terrible cost. The question now is whether we'd be able to obtain the same amount of growth that fossil fuels gave us without sacrificing the integrity of our environment. There is convincing evidence that this will actually be possible as in many parts of the world, renewables are in fact cheaper than fossil fuels per kWh. Then, it becomees a question of scale, since many of the renewables have their own idiosyncrasies which could inhibit mass-scale production and industrialization.
